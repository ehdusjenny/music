Look into:
1. Fourier Transformation
2. Fast Fourier Transformation
3. Prepare database
  * Extract audio from Youtube
4. Find chords
  * 
5. Find beats (Optional)
  * Comb filter

**TODO**:
* Read [THIS PAPER](http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/fmmh.pdf) by Sunday June 25th
* Learn about [CHORDS](http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/40)

# Musical Harmony Notes

## Keywords:
* **Tonic chord**: Triad built on the first scale degree (ex. C-E-G)
* **Scale degree**: Position of a particular note on a scale (tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, leading tone). Represents the relative interval between a tone and its tonic.
* **Tone**: Sound with a fixed frequency or pitch
* **Interval**: Distance between two notes
* **Semitone**: Smallest interval in Western tonal music
* **Harmony**: When two or more tones sound at the same time
* **Chords**: Group of tones sounding simultaneously, separated by intervals of roughly the same size. Characterized by its interval structure and the root.
* **Secondary dominants**: Dominant of a diatonic chord rather than the tonic.

Subdominant prepares a dominant by building up tension, dominant induces maximal tension, tonic releases the tension.

Deep connection between music and math pushed for music theorists to develop ways to analyze the function of a chord in its tonal context.
